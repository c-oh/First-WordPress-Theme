This is my first time creating a personalized wordpress theme. 
I used SASS/CSS3, PHP/HTML5 and JQuery/Javascript elements to create this page. 

##Struggles:
My biggest struggles in this project was understanding WORDPRESS hierachy and grasping my head around the fact that we could use a template, yet use different styles for various pages.

##What I learned:
What I enjoyed about this project is that it introduced me to how WordPress works, as I know have a strong understanding of the blogging platform.

##Future Changes:
Perhapes I can utilize more of WORDPRESS' own page classes instead of changing the PHP markup on my files.
