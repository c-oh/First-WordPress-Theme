This is my first time creating a personalized wordpress theme. 
I used SASS, PHP and JQuery elements to create this page. 

My biggest struggles in this project was understanding WORDPRESS hierachy and grasping my head around the fact that we could use a template, yet use different styles for various pages.

What I enjoyed about this project is that it introduced me to how WORDPRESS works, as I know have a strong understanding of the blogging platform.

Now I can make a WORDPRESS based theme.

Future Changes:
Perhapes I can utilize more of WORDPRESS' own page classes instead of changing the PHP markup on my files.
